# üêç Python Notebooks for Teaching (via Binder)

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks designed to introduce students to Python programming concepts ‚Äî **no installation required**. All notebooks can be launched directly in the browser via [MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org).

These materials are ideal for students learning topics such as vector projections, visualization, and linear algebra. Some notebooks focus on interactive visual exploration, while others provide exercises with hidden solutions for self-guided practice.
